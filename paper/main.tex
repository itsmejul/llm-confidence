\section{Correlation between token entropy and semantic similarity of tokens}
The entropy of token probability distributions has been proposed as a measure for LLM uncertainty.
We propose a new uncertainty measure, which is the average pairwise cosine similarity of the top-p tokens of a probability distribution.
In the following, we will show that there is a inverse relationship
